MD5 is an algorithm which generates a 128-bit hash, which is used to verify the integrity of data.

When a critical data is shared between two parties, the authenticity of the data needs to be verified,
whether the data is corrupted during transit or not.

md5sum is a function that uses MD5 algorithm which generates a 128-bit hash based on the data.

Let's first see how it is done on a terminal, Ubuntu has a built in command _md5sum_ and iOS has _md5_

```bash
$ echo 'hello world!' | md5sum
c897d1410af8f2c74fba11b1db511e9e
```

For the string **hello world!** the 128-bit hash is **c897d1410af8f2c74fba11b1db511e9e**

Now let's compare the result with a node js library [md5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/md5).

Create a simple package.json with [md5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/md5) as dependency and in a index.js file
use it to generate md5sum for the string **hello world!**

```js
{
  "name": "md5",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "generate md5sum",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "md5": "^2.3.0"
  }
}
```

```js
const md5sum = require("md5");

console.log(md5sum("hello world!"));
```

Let's run index.js

```bash
$ node index.js
fc3ff98e8c6a0d3087d515c0473f8677
```

The hash came out to be **fc3ff98e8c6a0d3087d515c0473f8677** which is completely different than **c897d1410af8f2c74fba11b1db511e9e**

### Why is the hash different?

By default the _echo_ command appends a new line character to the end of strings, so **hello world!** is considered as
**hello world!\n**. We have to explicitly tell _echo_ to not add new line character at the end. This is done using the _-n_ option

```bash
$ echo -n 'hello world!' | md5sum
fc3ff98e8c6a0d3087d515c0473f8677
```

Now both the hash generated on the terminal and using the node js package are similar.

This is all good for small strings but what about files.

### How to generate hash for files?

Let's create a simple text file named _**greetings.txt**_ and populate it with the string **hello world!**. The hash of the file will be

```bash
$ md5sum greetings.txt
c897d1410af8f2c74fba11b1db511e9e
```

This hash is exactly similar to the hash that was created before when _echo_ command was used without _-n_ option,
that is because a file will always have an new line appended. Read more [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file)

From the js side the file hash should look something similar

```js
const md5sum = require("md5");
const fs = require("fs");

const res = fs.readFileSync("./greetings.txt", { encoding: "utf8", flag: "r" });
console.log(md5sum(res));
```

```bash
$ node index.js
c897d1410af8f2c74fba11b1db511e9e
```

Yes they are similar as file is the same entity.

Let's consider a use case, there is a requirement to build a file upload service where user selects a file to
upload from a website and it gets uploaded to a remote server, to find out the integrity of the uploaded file we need to share the MD5 hash.

Should the hash be created in browser? The answer is **no**.

Let's figure out why, I will try to generate hash for a large file with size of 300 MB

```js
const md5sum = require("md5");
const fs = require("fs");

const res = fs.readFileSync("largeFile.mp4", { encoding: "utf8", flag: "r" });
console.log(md5sum(res));
```

```bash
$ node index.js
../.npm/charenc@0.0.2/node_modules/charenc/charenc.js:6
      return charenc.bin.stringToBytes(unescape(encodeURIComponent(str)));
                                                ^

RangeError: Invalid string length
    at encodeURIComponent (<anonymous>)
    at Object.stringToBytes (/Users/idks/Developer/test/node_modules/.pnpm/charenc@0.0.2/node_modules/charenc/charenc.js:6:49)
    ...
```

It failed because there is a limit to the string length in js. Read more [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length)

So ideally the browser should not be responsible for creating MD5 hash but rather it's the users responsibality to create the hash and share it with a remote server along with the file to verify it's integrity.
