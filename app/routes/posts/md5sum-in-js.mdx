MD5 is an algorithm which generates a 128-bit hash, which is used to verify the integrity of data.

When a crital data is shared between two parties, the authenticity of the data needs to be verified,
wheather the data is corrupted during transit or not.

md5sum is a function that uses MD5 algorithm which generates a 128-bit hash based on the data.

Let's first see how it is done on a terminal, Ubuntu has a built in command _md5sum_ and iOS has _md5_

```bash
$ echo 'hello world!' | md5sum
c897d1410af8f2c74fba11b1db511e9e
```

For the string **hello world!** the 128-bit hash is **c897d1410af8f2c74fba11b1db511e9e**

Now let's compare the result with a node js library [md5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/md5).
Create a simple package.json with [md5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/md5) as dependency and in a index.js file
use it to generate md5sum for the string **hello world!**

```js
{
  "name": "md5",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "generate md5sum",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "md5": "^2.3.0"
  }
}
```

```js
const md5sum = require('md5');

console.log(md5sum('hello world!'));
```

Let's run index.js

```js
> node index.js
fc3ff98e8c6a0d3087d515c0473f8677
```

The hash came out to be **fc3ff98e8c6a0d3087d515c0473f8677** which is completely different than **c897d1410af8f2c74fba11b1db511e9e**

### Why is the hash different?

By default the _echo_ command appends a new line character to the end of strings, so **hello world!** is considered as
**hello world!\n**. We have to explicitly tell _echo_ to not add new line character at the end. This is done using the _-n_ option

```bash
$ echo -n 'hello world!' | md5sum
fc3ff98e8c6a0d3087d515c0473f8677
```

Now both the hash generated on the terminal and using the node js package are similar.

This is all good for small strings but what about large files.
