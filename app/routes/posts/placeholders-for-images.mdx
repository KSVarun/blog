User experience is a critical factor for a web application,
having a UI that jumps based on the data load causes bad user experience.

Placeholders reserve space for a future content.

Let's look at some code

```html
<div class="img-container">
  <img src="profile-img.jpg" alt="profile-img" class="profile-img" />
</div>
```

We have a **div** with a class _img-container_ wrapping an **img** tag. Let's add some css

```css
.img-container {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
}

.profile-img {
  width: inherit;
  height: inherit;
}
```

With this, the **div** tag acts as a placeholder for the **img** tag and when the image loads the UI won't jump.

<img src={placeholderImage} alt='placeholder-image' />

Having an empty placeholder till the image loads is good, but we can take it one step further.
Let's show a loading indicator when the image is loading.

### How will I know when the image is loading and when the image has loaded completely?

By default images will start loading as soon as the page loads. So let's add a default loading indicator for our
image container **div**.

```css
:root {
  --placeholder-initial: #eeeeee;
  --placeholder-final: #cccccc;
}

.img-container {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  animation: placeholder ease-in-out 2s infinite;
}

@keyframes placeholder {
  0% {
    background-color: var(--placeholder-initial);
  }
  50% {
    background-color: var(--placeholder-final);
  }
  100% {
    background-color: var(--placeholder-initial);
  }
}

.profile-img {
  width: inherit;
  height: inherit;
  opacity: 0;
}
```

With this we will get a default loading indicator when the image is loading, notice the `opacity: 0` added
for _.profile-img_, we will know why that is needed a little bit later.

**img** tag gives a handly event called **onload**, this event will be triggered when the image is loaded completely.
Let's add it to our js file

```js
const imageEl = document.querySelector('.profile-img');
imageEl.onload = function () {
  imageEl.parentElement.classList.add('image-loaded');
  imageEl.style.opacity = '1';
};
```

<img src={placeholderLoader} alt='placeholder-loader' />

In the above code block, we are adding a class _image-loaded_ to the parent **div** which is the image container and updating the
opacity of the **img** to **1**.

### What is the need for updating the opacity of the img tag?

<img src={halfLoaded} alt='half-loaded-img' />

By default the img will render a part of the image that is downloaded, if the image is loaded 5% then that 5% of the image will be rendered.
This is again a bad user experience to avoid this, we won't be showing that partially rendered image. Hence **0** opacity is set on _.profile-img_
and it is updated to **1** in the **onload** event.

There is a chance that an image might fail to load, to handle this **img** tag gives one more handy event called **onerror**.

```js
imageEl.onerror = function () {
  imageEl.parentElement.classList.add('image-loaded');
  imageEl.style.opacity = '1';
};
```

<img src={brokenImage} alt='broken-img' />

We are basically doing the same thing when the image loads successfully or when the image fails to load,
to avoid duplication this can be extraced to a separate function

One last thing is removing animation from the parent **div** image container by updating styles for _image-loaded_ class

```css
.image-loaded {
  animation: none;
}
```
